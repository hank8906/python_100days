#Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word "TRUE" occurs. 
#Then check for the number of times the letters in the word "LOVE" occurs.
#Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#For Love Scores less than 10 or greater than 90, the message should be:
# "Your score is **x**, you go together like coke and mentos."

#For Love Scores between 40 and 50, the message should be:
# "Your score is **y**, you are alright together.

#"Otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g.:
# "Your score is **z**."

# 1.Check the times that "TRUE" and "LOVE" occur in both name
